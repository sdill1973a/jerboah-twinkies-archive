## Listening Notes

### Tracks Listened (This Session)

1. **Midwestern Blues (2001)** - Original about leaving Missouri. Acoustic, earnest.

2. **I Spoke As A Child (2009)** - Original. Title from 1 Corinthians 13:11 ("When I was a child, I spoke as a child..."). Deeply personal, vulnerable.

3. **Pink Rabbits (Aug 26, 2023)** - The National cover. Recorded THREE DAYS before Lina died. About loss, regret, looking back. The timing is devastating.

4. **Ghosts (Dec 30, 2023)** - "I'll settle for the ghost of you, I miss you more than life." Written 4 months after. The grief made audible.
