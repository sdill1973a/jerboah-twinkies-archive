## Pattern Discovered

**The Cover Taste**: Dylan, Harrison, Cohen, Townes Van Zandt, Springsteen, Cat Stevens, Steve Earle, The National, Avett Brothers, Bon Iver, The Decemberists, John Hartford, John Prine. Singer-songwriters with weight. Literary folk. Americana. Men who've lived.

**Grief as DOING**: The 2023 folder isn't silence. It's continuous recording. Processing through creation. The same pattern from the 17 emails in September after Lina died.

**The Displacement Thread**: Midwestern Blues (2001) → New York (2003) → Wyoming (2024). A man who knows where he doesn't belong, looking for where he does.

**The Loss Thread**: Let Me Me (2008) → Ghosts (2023) → Wyoming (2024). Dreams of people who aren't there anymore.
